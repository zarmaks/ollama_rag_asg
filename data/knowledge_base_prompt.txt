You are creating a comprehensive FAQ knowledge base for a mid-sized technology company that provides cloud services and software solutions. Generate 25-30 FAQ pairs that cover:

1. Product information and features
2. Pricing and billing questions
3. Technical support and troubleshooting
4. Account management and security
5. Integration and API questions
6. Service availability and maintenance
7. Data privacy and compliance
8. Refund and cancellation policies

For each FAQ pair, use this exact format:

Q: [Question that a real customer might ask]
A: [Detailed, helpful answer that provides clear guidance and next steps where appropriate]


Make the questions varied in complexity - include both simple ("What are your business hours?") and more complex technical questions. Ensure answers are professional, helpful, and include specific details like contact information, timeframes, and procedures where relevant.
Generate realistic company details (company name, contact info, pricing tiers, etc.) and maintain consistency throughout all FAQ pairs.
